- nip4.css should use classes for selected and shadow, not ids

  expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

- ^W on main window does not kill image windows

- maybe vertical columns should sizegroup their width together?

- paste into image window

  clipboard paste will need to write a new imageinfo to the heap, and
  can't be saved in workspace files

  in imagewindow_open_current_file() we write the filename back to the iimage,
  but this needs to handle iamges without filenames too

  maybe iimage should listen for "changed" in viewers and update the
  thumbnail and model?

- error_alert() should go (use window error bars)

- imagewindow progress stuff should go?

- changes to a row need to update any viewers

	A1 	$HOME/pics/k2.jpg
	A2	$HOME/pics/shark.jpg
	A3 	Image_file A1

  what does nip2 do for this?

	- imagemodel holds all model state for a view (settings etc.)
	- one item is the iimage the model represents
	- listens to "changed" on the iimage and updates the image in the
	  conversion

- column delete needs to

	queue a layout
	mark the filemodel as dirty
	queue a main_window refresh

  should this be in the model base class?

  same for column_set_open()

- hook up a progress bar for eg st-francis.jpg load?

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- columns "slip" during background scroll drag

	- we drag the shadow, not the actual cview

	- should the shadow include all the column widgets? we could just draw
	  a box? maybe CSS bg colour?

- try

	save with no filename
	pops save dialog
	save wsg
	... but does not set filename on filemodel
	don't see filename in header bar

- try

	wkkfhwf

  segv ... looks like the rowview is not being destroyed when we destroy
  the zombie symbol?

	vobject_iobject_destroy() is being called for the row

	it's calling UNPARENT

	but that isn't triggering dispose, so we still call refresh

	has refcount 2 at that point ... something else has a ref?

	still 2 after the unparent

  patched around this in vobject_iobject_destroy, but we still need to fix it

- revise column open/close code

	- watch signal on expander and use it to set the model

	- also need to set expander state in refresh I guess?

	- do column open/close animate?

	- click on column titlebar should not open/close column

- animate workspace layout

- animate scroll-to-keep-column-visible

	have a look at gtk_viewport_set_scroll_to_focus() ... could this
	do the work for us?

- watch column resize and trigger ws relayout

	- useful for eg relayout after column select, or col open/close, or
	  row add

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- does this need libadiwata?

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- need to do column caption edit

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
