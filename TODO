- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

- move gtkutil.c improvements back to vipsdisp

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this

- lots of util.c is now in libvips and can be removed

- next ... workspacegroupview ?
