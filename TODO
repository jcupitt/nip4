- have something to make a row (or column?) into a menu item?

	pressing the menu item loads a scrap of workspace, like copy/paste
	or duplicate

	pretty ugly and hard to reason about

## rows

- add multi-select to file open?

	gtk makes it hard to support single and multiple file select in
	one action

- implement range select then drag

	awkward to do since select is on the model, not the view

	we'd need to make a floating column (not just a columnview) and
	reparent the rows to it

## small

- start nip4, ^T, ^T, ^T, ^T, ^Q, leak one view

	view_dump(): 1 views
	0x55555baa6820 Workspaceview count=1

	how odd! and why only one?

  new tab button does the same thing

- new row type ... enter " (double quotes) as first character, then there's no
  need to terminate the string

  displayed slightly differently? maybe display all cells which are just a
  static string like this?

  maybe allow eg. "<span background=\"white\">hello</span>" too?

	formula isn't a great place to do this -- eg. "<function>" won't parse
	as markup

	a special graphical view widget for top-level strings would be better

## imagewindow

- next/prev in imagewindow often fails

	to do with background load and region ownership

	a libvips release build hides the error

	might fix region display error too

- need something to make next/prev block while the current image is loading

	we had this, when did it go?

	need it back anyway

- need something to make sure only one image loads at once?

- fix imagewindow copy/paste

  add copy/paste to mainwindow as well

- open imageview window for groups? < and > could move up and down the group

## vips8

- revise imageinfo for vips8

  imageinfo still does:

	- reference counting layer ... in Managed base class

		ie. integration with the nip2 GC

	- filesystem tracking: we stat open files and signal file_changed
	  if we see a change

	- cache: several open("fred.v")s share a single Imageinfo,
 	  provided their mtimes are all the same

	- imageinfo/expr association tracking, see expr_real_new_value()

	- lookup table management

  no longer does:

	- dependency tracking (libvips does this)

	- operation cache

	- temp file management

		must set the env var to point the libvuips temp file system at
		our folder

- action_proc_add() etc. etc. in action.c needs updating for vips8

	vo_callva() is done, still need to swap eg. "im_add" for "add"

		must test too

	vo_callva() also need to wrap and unwarp VipsImage <-> imageinfo

	vo_callva() can return a list of values for multiple required outputs

		is this a problem?

## toolkit browser

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	does this need libadiwata?

	where should workspace local defs go?

	need something like lpane / rpane

	just a pane with a revealer to make the lhs or rhs show and hide

	remove the "open" button from the top bar?

	use a treeview?

		see the lpane in program.c, but show as tools, not as
		definitions

	put workspace local defs in a pullout on the right? or maybe a popup

	put inside workspaceview, since tools are per workspace?

## ideas

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

## can't fix

- open dialogs have a "open read only" toggle at the bottom argh

	not clear how to remove this

- scroll to selected on ws change is annoying, where does it come from>?

	comment out workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb() and it's still there

  add a breakpoint for the scrolling and see what triggers it

  do we have a separate scrolled_window for each tab? what does the
  gtk_adjustment_set_value for the swin when we flip to it?

	wtf gtk_adjustment_set_value() is not being called on page flip,
	yet it's scrolling!

	maybe we should reset the scrollbars in
	workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb() from the saved view port

	no idea why this is happening

- expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

	doesn't seem to be possible with gtkimage

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

	entry text {
	  background-color: dimgrey;
	}

  works, but looks terrible

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

	  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- see if having a rowview menu for every row has a significant overhead

	x.ws has 1,000 rows

		before 366mb
		after: 566mb

	about 200mb, so /1000 is 200kb per row

	a significant saving!

	ws load is much faster without a menu per row

- when we drag a tab out, can we position the new window more intelligently?

	doesn't seem to be possible

- tab name vanishes in old wsgview, current tab indicators stop working

	in workspacegroupview_create_window_cb()

	is workspaceviewlabel doing something wrong?

	maybe we can force a redraw somehow?

	wsview->label hide/show?

		tried lots of things, none worked

	newer gtk4 doesn't seem to help
