- try subcolumnview

- UNPARENT() widgets, don't UNREF them

- add drag on background for workspace scroll

- add bg scroll for column drag outside viewport

	- see workspaceview_drag_update()

- revise column open/close code

	- watch signal on expander and use it to set the model

	- also need to set expander state in refresh I guess?

- columnview had just one child, a subcolumn ... that contains the grid widget

	- need to align the entry somehow?

- need to do column caption edit

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
