- add workspace load/save

	- so we can load a large workspace back for testing

	- implement "nip4 test.ws"

  save works, open not so much

- try

	wkkfhwf

  segv ... looks like the rowview is not being destroyed when we destroy
  the zombie symbol?

	vobject_iobject_destroy() is being called for the row

	it's calling UNPARENT

	but that isn't triggering dispose, so we still call refresh

	has refcount 2 at that point ... something else has a ref?

	still 2 after the unparent

  patched around this in vobject_iobject_destroy, but we still need to fix it

- add drag on background for workspace scroll

- add bg scroll for column drag outside viewport

	- see workspaceview_drag_update()

- style columns to be more griddy ... use a label for row name, add some bars

- revise column open/close code

	- watch signal on expander and use it to set the model

	- also need to set expander state in refresh I guess?

	- do column open/close animate?

- animate workspace layout

- watch column resize and trigger ws relayout

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- does this need libadiwata?

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- need to do column caption edit

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
