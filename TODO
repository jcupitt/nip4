- dragging tabs does not reorder workspaces

- need to call

	filemodel_set_modified(FILEMODEL(ws), TRUE)

  in various places where the user modifies a workspace ... we can't just
  rely on layout to do this for us

	column select
	ws tab drag
	new column
	new workspace

- scroll to selected on ws change is annoying

- see if having a rowview menu for every row has a significant overhead

	it's very unclear

- right click menu on row and ws background do not position popup menu
  correctly

- open view, change row once works, change row a seecond time fails to update

- should share tilesource between iimageview and imagewindow? we seem to
  reload right now


- expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

	doesn't seem to be possible with gtkimage

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

	entry text {
	  background-color: dimgrey;
	}

  works, but looks terrible

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

- paste into image window

  clipboard paste will need to write a new imageinfo to the heap, and
  can't be saved in workspace files

  in imagewindow_open_current_file() we write the filename back to the iimage,
  but this needs to handle iamges without filenames too

  maybe iimage should listen for "changed" in viewers and update the
  thumbnail and model?

- imagewindow progress stuff should go?

- hook up a progress bar for eg st-francis.jpg load?

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- try

	save with no filename
	pops save dialog
	save wsg
	... but does not set filename on filemodel
	don't see filename in header bar

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- does this need libadiwata?

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
