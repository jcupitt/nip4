- open twice on image thumbnail, close twice, ^Q, segv

  subcolumnview will not automatically kill its child views, since they are
  not true children

	  - views should listen for parent_dispose and kill themselves?
	  - views shoud be containers and track children properly?
	  - have a special thing just for subcolumnview?

  subcolumnview_dispose
  view_dispose: 0x56b1013b1170 "Subcolumnview"
  0x56b1013e6620 Rowview count=1 Row filename
  0x56b1013b3100 Rowview count=1 Row super
  0x56b1013e0d60 Rowview count=1 Row value

  subcolumnview will have many widget children (spin, label, rhs)*3 and they
  will go, but rowview will not

- column delete needs to

	queue a layout
	mark the filemodel as dirty
	queue a main_window refresh

  should this be in the model base class?

	iobject_destroy()
	iobject_real_destroy()

  same for column_set_open()

  same for column select

  same for column resize on a row getting bigger

  same for row delete

  we call

	view_resize(view);

  in view_dispose(), isn't this enough?

- columns "slip" during background scroll drag

	- we drag the shadow, not the actual cview

	- should the shadow include all the column widgets? we could just draw
	  a box? maybe CSS bg colour?

- changes to a row need to update any viewers

	A1 	$HOME/pics/k2.jpg
	A2	$HOME/pics/shark.jpg
	A3 	Image_file A1

  what does nip2 do for this?

	- imagemodel holds all model state for a view (settings etc.)
	- one item is the iimage the model represents
	- listens to "changed" on the iimage and updates the image in the
	  conversion

  row delete should also kill any viewers on that row

- expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

	doesn't seem to be possible with gtkimage

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

	entry text {
	  background-color: dimgrey;
	}

  works, but looks terrible

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

- ^W on main window does not kill image windows

- maybe vertical columns should sizegroup their width together?

- paste into image window

  clipboard paste will need to write a new imageinfo to the heap, and
  can't be saved in workspace files

  in imagewindow_open_current_file() we write the filename back to the iimage,
  but this needs to handle iamges without filenames too

  maybe iimage should listen for "changed" in viewers and update the
  thumbnail and model?

- imagewindow progress stuff should go?

- hook up a progress bar for eg st-francis.jpg load?

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- try

	save with no filename
	pops save dialog
	save wsg
	... but does not set filename on filemodel
	don't see filename in header bar

- animate workspace layout

- animate scroll-to-keep-column-visible

	have a look at gtk_viewport_set_scroll_to_focus() ... could this
	do the work for us?

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- does this need libadiwata?

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
