- UNPARENT() widgets, don't UNREF them

- revise column open/close code

	- watch signal on expander and use it to set the model

	- also need to set expander state in refresh I guess

- try colour change via css for column select

	- need a couple of columns for this

- columnview had just one child, a subcolumn ... that contains the grid widget

	- need to align the entry somehow?

- need to do column caption edit

- need to do column move and shadow stuff

	- see columnview_left_presss(), _motion() and _release() in nip2

	- use a gesture thing, see vipsdisp iamgewindow.c?

- need workspace relayout


- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
