- stack columns vertically, then try dragging another column through them

  we can split the columns apart!

  layout doesn't seem to be using the right x/y pos for cols if you trigger a
  layout during an animation

- set A1 to [1..100], should relayout

  queue a relayout on all row changes?

  or can we detect column width changes?

  looks like we need to implement custom resize for columnview

	https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Widget.html#height-for-width-geometry-management

	implement

		measure
		get_request_mode
		size_allocate

	and maybe don't set the gtk layout manager?

	just forward to frame, but note sizes as they pass through

- size columns together? not clear how easy sizegroup makes this

  could do this in layout with gtk_widget_set_size_request() and setting -1
  for height

- do we animate columns into place on load? this might look dumb

- on load, should scroll to make selected column visible

	not so easy ... this would have to be on a timeout I think
- changes to a row need to update any viewers

	A1 	$HOME/pics/k2.jpg
	A2	$HOME/pics/shark.jpg
	A3 	Image_file A1

  what does nip2 do for this?

	- imagemodel holds all model state for a view (settings etc.)
	- one item is the iimage the model represents
	- listens to "changed" on the iimage and updates the image in the
	  conversion

  row delete should also kill any viewers on that row

- expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

	doesn't seem to be possible with gtkimage

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

	entry text {
	  background-color: dimgrey;
	}

  works, but looks terrible

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

- ^W on main window does not kill image windows

- maybe vertical columns should sizegroup their width together?

- paste into image window

  clipboard paste will need to write a new imageinfo to the heap, and
  can't be saved in workspace files

  in imagewindow_open_current_file() we write the filename back to the iimage,
  but this needs to handle iamges without filenames too

  maybe iimage should listen for "changed" in viewers and update the
  thumbnail and model?

- imagewindow progress stuff should go?

- hook up a progress bar for eg st-francis.jpg load?

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- try

	save with no filename
	pops save dialog
	save wsg
	... but does not set filename on filemodel
	don't see filename in header bar

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- does this need libadiwata?

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
