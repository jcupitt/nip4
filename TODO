## rows

- dragging a row to the right of a very wide scrolled workspace breaks

- when dragging a row, it appears for a frame way way to the left

	the floating columnview seems to be made in the wrong place

- use a darkish grey (not pale greenish) for inactive labels, same for
  unselected column title bars, see nip2

	nip2 uses #454545 for row labels, #353535 for ws background

	nip4 has #272727 for ws background

		maybe 353535 for column bg, 454545 for label bg



- implement rage select then row delete

- implement rage select then row duplicate

- grab row, drag right (not up/down) a short way, drop, row moves up one

- implement range select then drag

- implement the rest of the row menu

## region display

- set "left" in workspace, drag, left only locks on drop

- need a right click menu? delete? could just rely on the workspace

## small

- column duplicate selects the new column

	maybe eg. drag row to column should also select the
	destination column?

- we make a gesture for every spin, could just use the gesture on the
  workspaceview

	would this save much time or memory? try commenting out the gesture
	stuff in the .ui file and benchmark

- can we speed up load by only making UI elements on demand? eg. itext
  should not make the entry until you click

	x.ws (1,000 rows) takes a good while to load

- maybe "are you sure?" for column delete

- next/prev in imagewindow often fails

	to do with background load and region ownership

	a libvips release build hides the error

	might fix region display error too

- need something to make next/prev block while the current image is loading

	we had this, when did it go?

	need it back anyway

- need something to make sure only one image loads at once?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this

- we have workspacegroup_save_selected() and workspace_selected_save() ???

## tab drag

- dragging tabs about can make workspaceviews leak, but only
  sometimes (!!?!?!)

	view_dump(): 2 views
	0x5555596c76f0 Workspaceview count=4
	0x5555595c1860 Workspaceview count=1

- cool if new tab button could go next to the rightmost tab, like chrome

## imagewindow

- fix imagewindow copy/paste

  add copy/paste to mainwindow as well

## vips8

- action_proc_add() etc. etc. in action.c needs updating for vips8

## toolkit browser

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	does this need libadiwata?

	where should workspace local defs go?

	need something like lpane / rpane

	just a pane with a revealer to make the lhs or rhs show and hide

	remove the "open" button from the top bar?

	use a treeview?

		see the lpane in program.c, but show as tools, not as
		definitions

	put workspace local defs in a pullout on the right? or maybe a popup

	put inside workspaceview, since tools are per workspace?

## ideas

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

## can't fix

- open dialogs have a "open read only" toggle at the bottom argh

	not clear how to remove this

- scroll to selected on ws change is annoying, where does it come from>?

	comment out workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb() and it's still there

  add a breakpoint for the scrolling and see what triggers it

  do we have a separate scrolled_window for each tab? what does the
  gtk_adjustment_set_value for the swin when we flip to it?

	wtf gtk_adjustment_set_value() is not being called on page flip,
	yet it's scrolling!

	maybe we should reset the scrollbars in
	workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb() from the saved view port

	no idea why this is happening

- expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

	doesn't seem to be possible with gtkimage

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

	entry text {
	  background-color: dimgrey;
	}

  works, but looks terrible

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

	  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- see if having a rowview menu for every row has a significant overhead

	x.ws has 1,000 rows

		before 366mb
		after: 566mb

	about 200mb, so /1000 is 200kb per row

	a significant saving!

	ws load is much faster without a menu per row

- when we drag a tab out, can we position the new window more intelligently?

	doesn't seem to be possible

- tab name vanishes in old wsgview, current tab indicators stop working

	in workspacegroupview_create_window_cb()

	is workspaceviewlabel doing something wrong?

	maybe we can force a redraw somehow?

	wsview->label hide/show?

		tried lots of things, none worked

	newer gtk4 doesn't seem to help
