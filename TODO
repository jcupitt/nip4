- image ++ image ... crash

- ctrl-bsp for delete selected?

- should we support

	A1.value + [1, 2, 3]

  ought to be easy and safe, though it's a lot of copy-paste

	maybe we can common-up some more code to make it easier?

  nip2 does it in the vector class, eg.

	A1 + Vector [10, 20, 30]

- should we wrap all vips8 operators? eg. could make

	vips_add a b = (vips_call "add" [a, b] [])?0

  as we do for vips7

	  not very useful? we'd lose optional args

  maybe:

	vips_add options a b = vips_call "add" [a, b] options

	x = vips_add [$uchar => true] y z

## test

- check the test ws we had for nip2

  there are a whole series of test wses in nip2/test/workspaces

## vips8

- startup defs contain LOTS of vips7 stuff, eg im_rot90 etc

	we are going to need a .def file with a lot of vips7 compat defs, eg.

		im_rot90 im = (vips_call "rot" [im, "d90"] [])?0

	maybe vips_call should not return single-element lists?

	make a vips7compat.def file, copy into all the old compat menu sets

	rewrite our current menu set for vips8


- vipsobject

	vo_new() could allocate the args array dynamically

	use vo_set_required_input() in the body of vo_call_fill_spine()

## rows

- add multi-select to file open?

	gtk makes it hard to support single and multiple file select in
	one action

- implement range select then drag

	awkward to do since select is on the model, not the view

	we'd need to make a floating column (not just a columnview) and
	reparent the rows to it

## small

- new row type ... enter " (double quotes) as first character, then there's no
  need to terminate the string

  displayed slightly differently? maybe display all cells which are just a
  static string like this?

  maybe allow eg. "<span background=\"white\">hello</span>" too?

	formula isn't a great place to do this -- eg. "<function>" won't parse
	as markup

	a special graphical view widget for top-level strings would be better

## imagewindow

- next/prev in imagewindow often fails

	to do with background load and region ownership

	a libvips release build hides the error

	might fix region display error too

- need something to make next/prev block while the current image is loading

	we had this, when did it go?

	need it back anyway

- need something to make sure only one image loads at once?

- fix imagewindow copy/paste

  add copy/paste to mainwindow as well

- open imageview window for groups? < and > could move up and down the group

## toolkit browser

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	does this need libadiwata?

	where should workspace local defs go?

	need something like lpane / rpane

	just a pane with a revealer to make the lhs or rhs show and hide

	remove the "open" button from the top bar?

	use a treeview?

		see the lpane in program.c, but show as tools, not as
		definitions

	put workspace local defs in a pullout on the right? or maybe a popup

	put inside workspaceview, since tools are per workspace?

## ideas

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

## can't fix

- open dialogs have a "open read only" toggle at the bottom argh

	not clear how to remove this

- scroll to selected on ws change is annoying, where does it come from>?

	comment out workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb() and it's still there

  add a breakpoint for the scrolling and see what triggers it

  do we have a separate scrolled_window for each tab? what does the
  gtk_adjustment_set_value for the swin when we flip to it?

	wtf gtk_adjustment_set_value() is not being called on page flip,
	yet it's scrolling!

	maybe we should reset the scrollbars in
	workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb() from the saved view port

	no idea why this is happening

- expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

	doesn't seem to be possible with gtkimage

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

	entry text {
	  background-color: dimgrey;
	}

  works, but looks terrible

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

	  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- see if having a rowview menu for every row has a significant overhead

	x.ws has 1,000 rows

		before 366mb
		after: 566mb

	about 200mb, so /1000 is 200kb per row

	a significant saving!

	ws load is much faster without a menu per row

- when we drag a tab out, can we position the new window more intelligently?

	doesn't seem to be possible

- tab name vanishes in old wsgview, current tab indicators stop working

	in workspacegroupview_create_window_cb()

	is workspaceviewlabel doing something wrong?

	maybe we can force a redraw somehow?

	wsview->label hide/show?

		tried lots of things, none worked

	newer gtk4 doesn't seem to help
