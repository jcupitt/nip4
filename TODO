  segv ... looks like the rowview is not being destroyed when we destroy
  the zombie symbol?

- add workspace load/save

	- so we can load a large workspace back for testing

	- implement "nip4 test.ws"

- swap

    g_object_ref(G_OBJECT(compile->heap));
    iobject_sink(IOBJECT(compile->heap));

  for iobject_ref_sink()

- use BIND_*() everywhere

- add drag on background for workspace scroll

- add bg scroll for column drag outside viewport

	- see workspaceview_drag_update()

- style columns to be more griddy ... use a label for row name, add some bars

- revise column open/close code

	- watch signal on expander and use it to set the model

	- also need to set expander state in refresh I guess?

	- do column open/close animate?

- animate workspace layout

- watch column resize and trigger ws relayout

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- columnview had just one child, a subcolumn ... that contains the grid widget

	- need to align the entry somehow?

- need to do column caption edit

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
