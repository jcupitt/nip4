- can we share a tilesource for all images? then maybe thumbnails would update
  when we move the display control bar?

  could have two views open on the same image and they'd share display
  settings? it might be annoying

  perhaps updating the thumbnail on imagewindow close is best

- imagewindow should update imageinfo when

	< > in imagewindow
	paste into image window
	replace file in imagewindow

  currently done by iimage_replace(), from iimage_graphic_replace(), from
  classmodel_graphic_replace()

  that's just for replace from file dialogs, we want a non-filesel replace

  how do other widgets do it? trigger the _edit method ... maybe replace from
  file should call Image_file.Image_file_edit? (is that right?)

- uncomment the extra css load in app.c and column select colours stop
  working, how bizarre

- column delete needs to

	queue a layout
	mark the filemodel as dirty
	queue a main_window refresh

  should this be in the model base class?

- rowview has a right_click_menu for the button and it doesn't work well

  do we make a separate menu for every rowview? can we share them?

  should probably just be a label

  try styling a label to look more spreadsheety

- hook up a progress bar for eg st-francis.jpg load?

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- columns "slip" during background scroll drag

	- we drag the shadow, not the actual cview

	- should the shadow include all the column widgets? we could just draw
	  a box? maybe CSS bg colour?

- try

	save with no filename
	pops save dialog
	save wsg
	... but does not set filename on filemodel
	don't see filename in header bar

- try

	wkkfhwf

  segv ... looks like the rowview is not being destroyed when we destroy
  the zombie symbol?

	vobject_iobject_destroy() is being called for the row

	it's calling UNPARENT

	but that isn't triggering dispose, so we still call refresh

	has refcount 2 at that point ... something else has a ref?

	still 2 after the unparent

  patched around this in vobject_iobject_destroy, but we still need to fix it

- revise column open/close code

	- watch signal on expander and use it to set the model

	- also need to set expander state in refresh I guess?

	- do column open/close animate?

	- click on column titlebar should not open/close column

- animate workspace layout

- animate scroll-to-keep-column-visible

	have a look at gtk_viewport_set_scroll_to_focus() ... could this
	do the work for us?

- watch column resize and trigger ws relayout

	- useful for eg relayout after column select, or col open/close, or
	  row add

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- does this need libadiwata?

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- need to do column caption edit

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
