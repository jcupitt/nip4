- make initial view from model

    - make a default workspace containing a column

    - need:

        workspace
        workspaceview
        column
        columnview


- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
