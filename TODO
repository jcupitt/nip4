# menu redesign

- use vips_image_guess_interpretation() in _predice.def get_interpretation

- vips_object_new has options at the end :(

- in order, rework:

	_predicate.def      done
	_stdenv.def
	_types.def





- get rid of all the im_functions

	except for _vips7compat.def

- see has_number / get_number and has_real / get_real in _predicate.def

    - should be is_number / to_number ?

- rename Image_interpretation as Interpretation

    Enum = class {
        // filter out names nip4 adds automatically
        names = filter (not @ member ["this", "name", "super", this.name]) (dir this);
        values = map (converse get_member this) names;

        has_name name = member name names;
        get_name value = names ? index value values;

        has_value value = member value values;
        get_value name = get_member name this;

        ...
    }

    Interpretation = class {
        value = class Enum {
            MULTIBAND = 0;
            B_W = 1;
            HISTOGRAM = 10;
        }

        display = class Enum {
            MULTIBAND = _ "Multiband";
            B_W = _ "Mono";
            HISTOGRAM = _ "Histogram";
        }



        ...
    }

  inter = Interpretation.value.HISTOGRAM;

  name = Interpretation.value.get_name inter;

  value = Interpretation.value.get_value "HISTOGRAM";

  label = Interpretation.display.get_name inter;





    Interpretation = Enum [
        ["MULTIBAND", _ "Multiband", 0],


- do we need vips_header_int as a builtin? we can define as

    vips_header_int field image
        = to_int value, is_int value
        = error ...
    {
        value = vips_header_get field image;
    }

- add to_enum

	allows str and real

- from _types.def remove

	 Image_interpretation

- remove these from Image class

- remove from _stdenv.def

	image_set_type

- image_set_interpretation in _stdenv.def should use vips_copy_set

- get rid of _colour_conversion_table ... use vips_colourspace instead

	see _convert.def

- try:

		Colour_new_item.CCT_colour.action
		to_image A1
		open viewer
		info bar does not display pixel values correctly
		mean A2 works

- maxpos, then create mark from coordinate should be two clicks

- try:

	minpair image constant

  fails with

	error in binary if_then_else
	left = <256x256 uchar, 1 band, b-w 0x55a4921d3ed0>
	right = [<256x256 float, 1 band, b-w 0x55a4918a6d60>, 12]
	called from "minpair"

  try:

	if_then_else (A11 < 12).value [A11.value, 12]

  also fails (works for Image though)

	because constant expansion is done by the Image class

  we'll need to do constant expansion in minpair

- the nip4 menus need reworking to use max_alpha 255 for scrgb

- add something to find unresolved symbols

- get rid of im_copy_set etc.

	add copy_set to stdenv, and that uses vips_call9

- perspective distort could have an "interpoplate" option (always bilinear
  right now)

- try:

	Matrix_build_item.Matrix_laplacian_item.action
	Matrix_build_item.Matrix_gaussian_item.action

  edit a cell and hit enter, lose the widgets, same happens in nip2
  do we need to define a Matrix_base member in Matrix_gaussian_item.action?

- add "smooth" option to union/intersection/difference?

	see https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/

  translate, rotate etc? need xyz for that

- Grey ramp, checkerboard, grid CIELAB slice -> Test Images

- magic kernel

- use vips_addalpha() operation

- remove use of cache (it's tilecache only now)

- prewitt and scharr edge detectors

- puts lots of stuff into Image > New eg xyz, sdf etc.

- can we improve Group[]?

- add magick7 support to _magick.def




- toolkitgroupview could have a non-scrolling version as the default

	context would be much clearer, though it would take loads of space

- add tab completion ... somewhat like VS intellisense?

	should work in workspace entry box, and in program window

		vips_fa |

		im_falsecolour in = ...
		im_fastcor in = ...
		vips_falsecolour: false-colour an image
		vips_fastcor: fast correlation

	maybe a bar down the right shows matches to the thing around the
	cursor?

	a popdown from the cursor shows what tab will complete to

	tooltips around mouse do lookups on text



- program: ^W should parse the text and block on error

- program: don't get save-before-close box for modified toolkits?

- program: add delete tool / toolkit?

- program: needs "find"?

- add magick7 support to _magick.def

- get judder with rotate and images smaller than the window

	draw on update, then draw again on relayout

	hard to fix

- show zoomed out tiles too

	should stop some more flicker

	seems tricky for some reason?

- load ws with locked tab, rightclick menu on locked tab does not
  have tick selected

  two tabs, lock one, p4menu on other also shows lock

	a bit tricky to fix

  maybe we are forced to have a separate menu for each tab?

- could use file chooser widget in bm-workspaces, what would it look like?

- check all batch mode flags

	see eg. vips-bench nip4 benchmark

- try to save and restore image view scale and position

	this failed last time I tried :(

- ^C on a computed animated GIF is only copying the first page

	a limitation of gdk_texture_new_from_bytes()

- use "propagate-natural-width" to get better fit of imageview window?

	aim for max 600px on any axis

	pick an initial scale

	drawingarea makes itself that size

		we need to implement the sizing machinery, however that works

	propogate size

	remove shrink-to-fit

  see imagewindow_set_tilesource() and uncomment the call to
  imageui_set_bestfit() to work on this again

- need preferences?

	or just remove it all

- iimage.h has:

	gboolean show_status;
	gboolean show_paintbox;
	gboolean show_convert;

  do we use these?

- investigate behaviour with updated iimage_update_heap() ... there will be
  quite a few cases which now fail (I expect)

- save as TIFF, pick a set of options which will fail (eg. deflate + float
  predictor), save, get error, fix options, save again, get:

	(nip4:3658140): VIPS-WARNING **: 12:51:27.408: ../libvips/iofuncs/object.c:1231: VipsForeignSaveTiffFile can only assign 'nickname' once
	(nip4:3658140): VIPS-WARNING **: 12:51:27.408: ../libvips/iofuncs/object.c:1231: VipsForeignSaveTiffFile can only assign 'description' once

## program

- restore scroll positions on menu path set

- in program window, search is cleared on refresh

	eg. search for is_Plot, click on it, list fills again

	not clear why this happens? we try to restore the search string
	and filter

## imagewindow

- open imageview window for groups? < and > could move up and down the group

	or disable < > ref for computed images?

	need a groupview widget

	it would need to make a model for every element in the group, then
	display a set of views

## ideas

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

## program window

- get rid of

	 TOOL_DIA, TOOL_SEP

- for a click on a computed tool, could scroll to or highlight the text?

- find and find all could be in a "uses" pane on the right?

- drag in left to reorder tools and toolkits

	argh!

  I suppose we will need our own two-level tree view

## toolkit browser

- double-click in browse mode will add two pages with the same name

	harmless, but you get a warning

- often see

	view_dump(): 3 views
	0x5e14b821e120 Workspacedefs count=2
	0x5d40451c8110 Toolkitgroupview count=2
	0x5d40447a9790 Workspaceview count=1

  on shutdown

  could wsdefs and tkview be referencing workspaceview?

  maybe we are sometimes using VIPS_UNREF() rather than IDESTROY()?

## other

- remove the "open" button from the top bar? not very useful

- put a time delay on row label colour change -- stop the flashing

	we have vobject_refresh_queue(), but that does all views, we just
	want to delay colour changes

	maybe do a separate pass at the end of recomp that sets label colours?

	could use this to make parent/child colour change only show after a
	while ... might look better

- this fails:

	im_insertset main sub x y
		= foldr add_another main (zip2 x y)
	{
		add_another [x, y] im = insert x y sub im;
	}

  you have to do:

		add_another pos im
			= insert x y sub im
		{
			x = pos?0;
			y = pos?1;
		}

  strange!

- in a workspace do:

	x = [1, 2, 3]

  now ZF expressions which use x will stop working, eg.:

	[x * 2 :: x <- [1..]]

- syntax error in startup .def stops nip4 loading

- should we support

	A1.value + [1, 2, 3]

  ought to be easy and safe, though it's a lot of copy-paste

	maybe we can common-up some more code to make it easier?

  nip2 does it in the vector class, eg.

	A1 + Vector [10, 20, 30]

- should we wrap all vips8 operators? eg. could make

	vips_add a b = vips_call "add" [a, b] []

  as we do for vips7

	  not very useful? we'd lose optional args

  maybe:

	vips_add options a b = vips_call "add" [a, b] options

	x = vips_add [$uchar => true] y z

## plotting

- in plotdisplay_build_kplot()

	set ksmthtype to smooth a series (PLOT_STYLE_SPLINE) see
	kplot_attach_smooth()

		not really a spline, more like a blur, this would be better in
		libvips

	maybe use error bars plus thickness to draw a bar?

	leave it for now, not very important

## vips8

- vipsobject

	vo_new() could allocate the args array dynamically

	use vo_set_required_input() in the body of vo_call_fill_spine()

## rows

- add multi-select to file open?

	gtk makes it hard to support single and multiple file select in
	one action

- implement range select then drag

	awkward to do since select is on the model, not the view

	we'd need to make a floating column (not just a columnview) and
	reparent the rows to it

- new row type ... enter " (double quotes) as first character, then there's no
  need to terminate the string

  displayed slightly differently? maybe display all cells which are just a
  static string like this?

  maybe allow eg. "<span background=\"white\">hello</span>" too?

	formula isn't a great place to do this -- eg. "<function>" won't parse
	as markup

	a special graphical view widget for top-level strings would be better
