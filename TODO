## program window

- toolkitgroupview needs to track the currently displayed thing and recreate
  that column on _refresh, if possible

	bounce back to root display if the thing being displayed has
	been deleted

- get rid of

	 TOOL_DIA, TOOL_SEP

- update status bar

## toolkit browser

- double-click in browse mode will add two pages with the same name

	harmless, but you get a warning

- often see

	view_dump(): 3 views
	0x5e14b821e120 Workspacedefs count=2
	0x5d40451c8110 Toolkitgroupview count=2
	0x5d40447a9790 Workspaceview count=1

  on shutdown

  could wsdefs and tkview be referencing workspaceview?

  maybe we are sometimes using VIPS_UNREF() rather than IDESTROY()?

## other

- close column, select column, click Colour > New > Colour, column should pop
  open since a row has been added to it

- we really need cursor changes for region manipulation

- Colour / New / Colour, convert to scRGB, black!

- image, convert to srgb, Convert to Colour

	fails with eg. "26 not in table" for many colourspaces

- when dragging a row, always select destination column on drop

	since the source column could be selected ... if this was the only
	row, we'll then have no selected column

- remove the "open" button from the top bar? not very useful

	could be an icon, see vipsdisp

- try:

	Matrix_build_item.Matrix_laplacian_item.action

	Matrix_build_item.Matrix_gaussian_item.action

  edit a cell and hit enter, lose the widgets, same happens in nip2

  do we need to define a Matrix_base member in Matrix_gaussian_item.action?

- put a time delay on row label colour change -- stop the flashing

	we have vobject_refresh_queue(), but that does all views, we just
	want to delay colour changes

	maybe do a separate pass at the end of recomp that sets label colours?

- check the driver script that runs all test workspaces .. do we need to
  implement batch mode?

	need --test and --prefix

	need to run the driver script from meson

- this fails:

	im_insertset main sub x y
		= foldr add_another main (zip2 x y)
	{
		add_another [x, y] im = insert x y sub im;
	}

  you have to do:

		add_another pos im
			= insert x y sub im
		{
			x = pos?0;
			y = pos?1;
		}

  strange!

- in a workspace do:

	x = [1, 2, 3]

  now ZF expressions which use x will stop working, eg.:

	[x * 2 :: x <- [1..]]

- row reset doesn't always work

  and editing a row doesn't always "take"

- syntax error in startup .def stops nip4 loading

- ctrl-bsp for delete selected rows?

	we can't set accels on action menus, since the windiow won't know
	what view to pass the action to, see mainwindow_view_action()

	maybe action menus should be on the class, not the object?

- should we support

	A1.value + [1, 2, 3]

  ought to be easy and safe, though it's a lot of copy-paste

	maybe we can common-up some more code to make it easier?

  nip2 does it in the vector class, eg.

	A1 + Vector [10, 20, 30]

- should we wrap all vips8 operators? eg. could make

	vips_add a b = vips_call "add" [a, b] []

  as we do for vips7

	  not very useful? we'd lose optional args

  maybe:

	vips_add options a b = vips_call "add" [a, b] options

	x = vips_add [$uchar => true] y z

## widgets TODO

- still to do:

    (void) g_type_class_ref(TYPE_CLOCK);
    (void) g_type_class_ref(TYPE_GROUP);
    (void) g_type_class_ref(TYPE_REAL);
    (void) g_type_class_ref(TYPE_VECTOR);

  maybe skip clock

## plotting

- in plotdisplay_build_kplot()

	set ksmthtype to smooth a series (PLOT_STYLE_SPLINE) see
	kplot_attach_smooth()

		not really a spline, more like a blur, this would be better in
		libvips

	maybe use error bars plus thickness to draw a bar?

	leave it for now, not very important

## vips8

- vipsobject

	vo_new() could allocate the args array dynamically

	use vo_set_required_input() in the body of vo_call_fill_spine()

## rows

- add multi-select to file open?

	gtk makes it hard to support single and multiple file select in
	one action

- implement range select then drag

	awkward to do since select is on the model, not the view

	we'd need to make a floating column (not just a columnview) and
	reparent the rows to it

## small

- new row type ... enter " (double quotes) as first character, then there's no
  need to terminate the string

  displayed slightly differently? maybe display all cells which are just a
  static string like this?

  maybe allow eg. "<span background=\"white\">hello</span>" too?

	formula isn't a great place to do this -- eg. "<function>" won't parse
	as markup

	a special graphical view widget for top-level strings would be better

## imagewindow

- next/prev in imagewindow often fails

	to do with background load and region ownership

	a libvips release build hides the error

	might fix region display error too

- need something to make next/prev block while the current image is loading

	we had this, when did it go?

	need it back anyway

- need something to make sure only one image loads at once?


- fix imagewindow copy/paste

  add copy/paste to mainwindow as well

- open imageview window for groups? < and > could move up and down the group

	or disable < > ref for computed images?

## ideas

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?
