## tab drag

- workspaceviewlabel_pressed() should not change workspace, we reply on
  notebook for that, though it can trigger layout

- drag tab to new wsg, ^Q, assert fails in view_real_child_remove()

- can't drag tabs into an existing workspacegroupview

	see https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/method.Notebook.set_tab_detachable.html

- start x2.ws, new workspace, ^Q, assert fail

  works with x3.ws?

  x3 new ws is:

	workspaceview_init: FIXME we must do stuff
	workspacegroupview_child_add:
	workspaceview_link: FIXME toolkitbrowser, panes, etc.
	icontainer_real_current: parent Workspace "tab1"; child Column "A"
	icontainer_real_current: parent Workspacegroup "x3"; child Workspace "tab1"
	workspacegroupview_child_front:
	set_symbol_drag_type: FIXME .. implement this

  x2 new ws is

	workspaceview_init: FIXME we must do stuff
	workspacegroupview_child_add:
	workspaceview_link: FIXME toolkitbrowser, panes, etc.
	icontainer_real_current: parent Workspace "tab3"; child Column "A"
	icontainer_real_current: parent Workspacegroup "x2"; child Workspace "tab3"
	workspacegroupview_child_front:
	set_symbol_drag_type: FIXME .. implement this

  ^Q assert fail is

	view_model_child_attach
	icontainer_reparent
	workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb
	gtk_notebook_switch_page
	gtk_notebook_remove
	workspacegroupview_child_remove

  stray views being left after drag?

## small

- we have workspacegroup_save_selected() and workspace_selected_save() ???

- open dialogs have a "open read only" toggle at the bottom argh

	not clear how to remove this

- look at adding file type stuff, there are hooks for it, see
  gtk_file_dialog_set_default_filter() and:

	https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.FileFilter.html

- polish "about nip4"

- scroll to selected on ws change is annoying, where does it come from>?

	see workspacegroupview_switch_page_cb()

  add a breakpoint for the scrolling and see what triggers it






- see if having a rowview menu for every row has a significant overhead

	it's very unclear

	x.ws has 1,000 rows

- right click menu on row and ws background do not position popup menu
  correctly

- open view, change row once works, change row a seecond time fails to update

- should share tilesource between iimageview and imagewindow? we seem to
  reload right now


- expand and close buttons in column title should be grey when label text is
  grey

	doesn't seem to be possible with gtkimage

  column entry needs a background colour to make it more visible

	entry text {
	  background-color: dimgrey;
	}

  works, but looks terrible

- we have the css_name thing in several _refresh() methods ... should this be
  in the base class?

- paste into image window

  clipboard paste will need to write a new imageinfo to the heap, and
  can't be saved in workspace files

  in imagewindow_open_current_file() we write the filename back to the iimage,
  but this needs to handle iamges without filenames too

  maybe iimage should listen for "changed" in viewers and update the
  thumbnail and model?

- imagewindow progress stuff should go?

- hook up a progress bar for eg st-francis.jpg load?

- imagedisplay should not draw the focus rect ... get the base widget class
  to do that for us

  doesn't seem to be possible with drawing area?

- try

	save with no filename
	pops save dialog
	save wsg
	... but does not set filename on filemodel
	don't see filename in header bar

- use a filemanager style left bar for the toolkit browser

	- does this need libadiwata?

	- where should workspace local defs go?

- status bar? space free indicator is handy ... could this go somewhere else?
  maybe in "about"?

- make a "progress" widget with throttled updates? could share with
  saveoptions, and move some code out of mainwindow

	- we have progress.c, does that work?

- there's a 20ms timeout in vobject_refresh_queue() ... tune this
