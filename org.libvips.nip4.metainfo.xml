    <p>
nip4 is a GUI for the libvips image processing library. It's a little
like a spreadsheet: you create a set of formula connecting your objects
together, and on a change nip2 will recalculate. This makes it convenient
for developing image processing systems since you can watch pixels change
as you adjust your equations.

Because nip4 uses libvips as the image processing engine it can handle very
large images and only needs a little memory. It scales to fairly complex
workflows: I've used it to develop systems with more than 10,000 cells,
analyzing images of many tens of gigabytes. It has a batch mode, so you
can run any image processing system you develop from the command-line and
without a GUI.
